Your job though isn't just to survive but to rebuild along side it. Buildings will help you achieve that goal. It is also where you can make the cure to win.

Tap the button with a hammer to open the build menu. Once there, tap on the question mark there for a tutorial.

You can't just stay here though, at least at the beginning. You need to gather resources and people, and to do that in the early stages you need to send out expeditions.

Tap on one of the people to select them for an expedition. You will select everyone to the left (or right depending on your settings). If you do not like the order your people are in, you can tap on a person's name to open up a menu and have that person swap places. You can tap on the i next to their names to learn more about them.

Either of the below buttons to progress to the next day. If the button is a van, it means that you will also be starting a mission.

Once there tap the question mark to see the tutorial for there.
